SDMD-Renewed
============

This is the home of the currently-in-development of the well-loved Warcraft 3 map Scarlet Devil Mansion Defense 
(Lovingly translated and distributed here: http://blog.midnightinsomnia.com/2013/10/09/scarlet-devil-mansion-defence-v0-30/)

Anyway, I'll be working on transcribing an English version of this adventure/wave defense map into Dota 2 using Hammer.

This is my first Dota 2 custom mode, so any advice on the intracacies of Dota 2 addon file layout, Lua control, and triggers would be appreciated. Thanks to BMDDota and his barebones mod, which has been a great help for learning how things work.

ARTISTS WILLING TO WORK ON ANIMATIONS/MODELS/TEXTURES/SOUNDS FOR TOUHOU CHARACTERS IN SDMD RENEWED WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. 

Changelog:

8/29/2014
-------------
So I'm really bad at pushing, too.

Map: Finished defining lanes, round 1 of hero clip zones placed. Probably needs more hero_clip.

Triggers: Warps operational, but not placed in map

Scripting: Major progress. Iku 3/9 implemented, warp code functional.

Models and textures: Still nope. Probably should hack from WC3 at some point...

Sounds: Nope.

-------------
Got around to actually making a repo.

Map: First draft, most things are in the right place, boss arenas are probably the right size.

Triggers: None whatsoever

Scripting: Zilch

Models and textures: Nope

Sounds: Nothing doing
