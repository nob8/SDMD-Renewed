SDMD-Renewed
============

This is the home of the currently-in-development of the well-loved Warcraft 3 map Scarlet Devil Mansion Defense 
(Lovingly translated and distributed here: http://blog.midnightinsomnia.com/2013/10/09/scarlet-devil-mansion-defence-v0-30/)

Anyway, I'll be working on transcribing an English version of this adventure/wave defense map into Dota 2 using Hammer.

This is my first Dota 2 custom mode, so any advice on the intracacies of Dota 2 addon file layout, Lua control, and triggers would be appreciated. Thanks to BMDDota and his barebones mod, which has been a great help for learning how things work.

ARTISTS WILLING TO WORK ON ANIMATIONS/MODELS/TEXTURES/SOUNDS FOR TOUHOU CHARACTERS IN SDMD RENEWED WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.
